# Echo STT Service Testing Guide

This guide explains how to test the Speech-to-Text (STT) service with dynamic microphone resampling functionality.

## Prerequisites

1. **Activate Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Linux/Mac
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Check Microphone**: Ensure your microphone is working and set as the default input device.

## Test Scripts Overview

### 1. Basic API Test (`test_stt_basic.py`)
Tests all STT API endpoints without requiring user interaction.

**Features Tested**:
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoints
- ‚úÖ STT service status and configuration
- ‚úÖ Audio device detection
- ‚úÖ Dynamic sample rate detection and resampling info
- ‚úÖ Whisper model management
- ‚úÖ Complete recording workflow (simulated)

**Run Command**:
```bash
python test_stt_basic.py
```

### 2. Interactive Hotkey Test (`test_stt_with_hotkey.py`)
Full interactive testing with F8 hotkey functionality.

**Features Tested**:
- ‚úÖ All basic API functionality
- ‚úÖ F8 hotkey press-and-hold recording
- ‚úÖ Real-time audio capture and transcription
- ‚úÖ Dynamic resampling (native rate ‚Üí 16kHz for Whisper)
- ‚úÖ Interactive user experience

**Run Command**:
```bash
python test_stt_with_hotkey.py
```

## Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Run Basic Tests
```bash
python test_stt_basic.py
```

**Expected Output**:
- Service initialization ‚úÖ
- Audio device detection ‚úÖ
- Sample rate information showing native vs target rates
- Whisper model loading status
- API endpoints responding correctly

### Step 2: Run Interactive Hotkey Tests
```bash
python test_stt_with_hotkey.py
```

**Test Options**:
1. **Hotkey Testing**: Press and hold F8 to record, release to stop
2. **Manual Recording**: 3-second automated recording test
3. **Both**: Run manual test then switch to hotkey mode

### Step 3: Test the Dynamic Resampling
The tests will show:
- **Native Sample Rate**: Your microphone's default rate (usually 44.1kHz or 48kHz)
- **Target Sample Rate**: 16kHz (Whisper requirement)
- **Resampling Status**: Whether resampling is needed
- **Resampling Method**: librosa with scipy fallback

## Key Features Being Tested

### üéôÔ∏è Dynamic Microphone Resampling
- Automatically detects your microphone's native sample rate
- Captures audio at native quality (44.1kHz/48kHz)
- Resamples to 16kHz before feeding to Whisper
- Uses high-quality librosa resampling with scipy fallback

### ‚å®Ô∏è F8 Hotkey Functionality
- Press and hold F8 to start recording
- Release F8 to stop and process transcription
- Visual feedback in console
- ESC key to exit

### ü§ñ Whisper Integration
- Lazy model loading (loads only when needed)
- Configurable models (tiny, base, small, medium, large)
- Automatic language detection
- Confidence scoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **ModuleNotFoundError**: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **No Audio Devices Found**:
   - Check microphone connection
   - Verify default input device in system settings

3. **Sample Rate Issues**:
   - The system auto-detects and handles different sample rates
   - Check console output for sample rate information

4. **Hotkey Not Working**:
   - Ensure the application has focus
   - Try running as administrator (Windows)
   - Check that F8 is not bound to other applications

5. **Whisper Model Loading Slow**:
   - First run downloads models (can take time)
   - Subsequent runs use cached models
   - Start with 'tiny' model for faster testing

### Debug Information:

The tests provide detailed debug output:
- Audio device enumeration
- Sample rate detection and resampling info
- Recording state transitions
- Transcription results with confidence scores
- Error messages with specific failure points

## Next Steps

After successful testing, the STT service is ready for integration with:
- Task 2.2: Hotkey Management System
- Task 2.3: WebSocket Communication
- Frontend voice recording interfaces

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the detailed console output for specific error messages
2. Verify all prerequisites are met
3. Ensure microphone permissions are granted
4. Test with different Whisper models if needed
