# üéôÔ∏è Echo ‚Äì Your Private AI Journal
([Frontend Walkthrough](https://github.com/29sayantanc/Echo/blob/main/Documentation/Walkthrough/echo_frontend_walkthrough_updated.md)),            ([Backend Flow Diagram](https://29sayantanc.github.io/Echo/))


## The Problem: 

Ever tried to dig up that brilliant idea from last Tuesday‚Äôs meeting‚Ä¶ and found it buried under half-written notes, or a pile of voice memos you never listen to?  
Most journaling apps are just fancy text boxes. Note-taking apps spread your thoughts across too many places. Voice memos sit in a folder like a junk drawer you‚Äôre afraid to open.

**Echo changes that.**  

Type your thoughts directly, record them on the spot, or even paste in text from elsewhere. Got old voice notes? Drop them in ‚Äî Echo transcribes and processes them so your ideas become searchable, connected, and actually useful.

It‚Äôs not just storage ‚Äì it‚Äôs your personal AI that remembers and connects your thoughts. And it doesn‚Äôt even need the internet to work. Imagine that.

## What is Echo?

Echo turns scattered thoughts into an intelligent, searchable memory system:

- **üîí 100% Local** ‚Äì Your data stays on your device. No cloud. No subscriptions. No spying.
- **üß† Smart Memory** ‚Äì AI extracts facts, preferences, and patterns from your entries.
- **üéØ Powerful Search** ‚Äì Find entries by meaning, keywords, or context.
- **üí¨ Natural Chat** ‚Äì Ask Echo about your thoughts like talking to a friend.
- **üé§ Voice-First** ‚Äì Speak naturally, Echo transcribes and processes everything.

## Real Use Cases (Not Just ‚ÄúDear Diary‚Äù)

**Work Profile:**
- Track daily meetings, decisions, and deal progress.
- Remember client preferences and conversation details.  
- Search: *‚ÄúWhat did I discuss with Sarah about the Q3 strategy?‚Äù*
- Analyze patterns: *‚ÄúShow me all blockers from last month.‚Äù*

**Personal Profile:**
- Journal relationships, goals, and life decisions.
- Remember recommendations and important conversations.
- Spot patterns in mood and energy levels.
- Vent freely, knowing it‚Äôs completely private.

**Project Profile:**
- Keep a record of research, ideas, and progress.
- Track what worked and what didn‚Äôt.
- Connect related concepts across time.
- Build a personal knowledge base you can search anytime.

## Quick Start

**You need:** Python 3.11+, Node.js 20+, and [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) installed on your system.

1. **Clone the repo**  

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/29sayantanc/echo.git
    cd echo
    ```

2. **Install**  

   Go to the `scripts/install` folder and run the installer for your OS:  

   - **Windows**: double-click `install.bat` or run:  

     ```bash
     scripts/install/install.bat
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**:  

     ```bash
     bash scripts/install/install.sh
     ```
   - **Python-only option** (cross-platform):  

     ```bash
     python scripts/install/install.py
     ```

3. **Run Echo**  

   After installation completes, use the launch script for your OS:  

   - **Windows**:  

     ```bash
     scripts/run/launch.bat
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**:  

     ```bash
     bash scripts/run/launch.sh
     ```
   - **Python-only option**:  

     ```bash
     python scripts/run/launch.py
     ```

4. **Install AI models** *(first run only)*  

    ```bash
    ollama pull qwen3:8b
    ollama pull mistral:7b
    ```

Once the launch script runs, Echo will automatically open in your default browser ([http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)).

## My Story

*I Googled ‚Äúwhat is an LLM‚Äù 2 months ago because I wanted to understand how AI actually works. I came into this without any substantial coding experience ‚Äì just curiosity, a lot of reading, and the help of AI tools. Echo started as weekend tinkering, turned into something I use daily. Always open to suggestions and feedback!*

## Built With

- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI + SQLite + Sentence Transformers
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS  
- **AI**: Ollama + Whisper + BGE embeddings + Piper TTS
- **Architecture**: Async processing, memory systems, tool-calling agents

## Development Credits

**AI Coding Assistants:**
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) ‚Äì Primary development and architecture implementation.
- [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) ‚Äì Code editing and debugging assistance.  
- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-cli) ‚Äì Additional coding support.

**Documentation:**
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/) ‚Äì Technical documentation and user guides.
- [GPT + Monday](https://openai.com/) ‚Äì Additional documentation support.

**Open Source Projects used:**
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) ‚Äì Local LLM inference engine.
- [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) ‚Äì Speech-to-text transcription.
- [Piper TTS](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl) ‚Äì Neural text-to-speech synthesis.
- [BGE Embeddings](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) ‚Äì Semantic embeddings model.
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) ‚Äì Modern Python web framework.
- [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) ‚Äì Embedded database engine.

**Development Approach:**

This project demonstrates AI-assisted development ‚Äì I provided the vision, architecture decisions, and user experience design, while AI coding assistants handled the implementation. Every line of code was written by AI according to my specifications and requirements.
